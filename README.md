# Polarity ChatGPT Integration

The Polarity ChatGPT integration leverages the OpenAI ChatGPT REST API to answer your questions.  The integration will respond to any search terms that end in a question mark. Note that multi-line strings will not be searched to reduce false positive searches.

The ChatGPT API is limited to conversations with less than 4096 tokens.  The integration keeps the history of your chat locally to provide context for ChatGPT but will not work over 4096 tokens. The integration includes a token counter and allows you to clear your conversation if it is getting too long.
